MySQL is (as of July 2013) the world's most widely used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS), enabling the cost-effective delivery of reliable, high-performance and scalable Web-based and embedded database applications. It is widely-used as the database component of LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python) web application software stack.

MySQL was developed by Michael Widenius and David Axmark in 1994. Presently MySQL is maintained by Oracle (formerly Sun, formerly MySQL AB).
